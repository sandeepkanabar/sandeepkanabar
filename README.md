I'm Sandeep Kanabar, a Lead Software Engineer at Gen (formerly NortonLifeLock). I'm passionate about building reliable and scalable software solutions on AWS and GCP, with a particular focus on Elasticsearch. Outside of work, I enjoy reading spiritual books, visiting ancient temples, mentoring and volunteering by giving back to the community.

In addition to my day job, I'm actively involved in the tech community. Here are some highlights:
- Honoured with [Elastic Bronze Contributor award](https://www.credential.net/b6eb180b-45a7-4917-93e0-0304a30b8de5) in 2023 for actively contributing to the community (Top 30 in APAC).
- Active AWS Community Builder and [speaker](https://www.youtube.com/live/NyxZHZhE0M8?si=3XT_6b6U4dUuPX_W) at AWS Community India 2022.
- Featured in Developers of AWS: ["People come in different forms, but they are all people first"](https://www.aboutamazon.in/news/aws/people-come-in-different-forms-but-they-are-all-people-first)
- Active member of CNCF Deaf/HoH WG, contributing to conference best practices and advocating for accessible meetups.

I'm a person with hearing impairment and rely entirely on lip-reading and captioning. My journey overcoming non-inclusive hiring processes and advocating for inclusivity within my organization inspired me to form an ERG (Employee Resource Group) at Gen.

The agnhost container has a `/shell` endpoint, which is useful for debugging,  
but dangerous to expose to the public internet. Do not run this on an  
internet-facing cluster, or a production cluster.
